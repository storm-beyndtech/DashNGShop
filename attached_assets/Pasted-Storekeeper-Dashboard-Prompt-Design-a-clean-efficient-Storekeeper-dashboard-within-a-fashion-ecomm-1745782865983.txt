Storekeeper Dashboard Prompt

Design a clean, efficient Storekeeper dashboard within a fashion ecommerce app. The dashboard should focus on inventory management and provide the necessary shipment/order visibility, without overwhelming the storekeeper with business-level analytics.

Core Functionalities:
1. Upload and Manage Inventory

Upload product images (support multiple images per item: front view, side view, back view, label/brand close-up).

Enter product details:

Product Name

SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)

Category (e.g., Men, Women, Accessories)

Size Variants (S, M, L, XL)

Color Options

Quantity in Stock

Cost Price and/or Suggested Selling Price

Description

Edit or delete product listings as needed.

View current inventory stock levels with low-stock alerts.

2. Create and Update Stock Records

Update stock quantity when:

New shipments arrive.

Internal stock adjustments are needed (e.g., damaged goods, returns).

Track inventory changes with a stock movement log (who added, edited, or removed stock and when).

3. View Shipments and Order Status (Basic View Only)

See incoming shipment tracking (e.g., "Shipment #123: In Transit", "Shipment #456: Delivered").

See orders that have been processed and need inventory fulfillment (e.g., "Order #789: Packing in Progress").

No permission to edit shipments or orders ‚Äî view-only access.

Additional Practical Features:
Barcode/QR Code generator for items.

Bulk Upload option (via CSV file for large inventory uploads).

Searchable inventory table (filter by Product Name, SKU, Category).

Mobile camera integration (optional) for photo uploads right from mobile.

Notifications (e.g., "New shipment arriving tomorrow").

üí° Suggestions to Make It Even More Practical
Inventory Audit Mode:
Add a simple feature where the storekeeper can mark inventory as ‚Äúchecked/verified‚Äù during physical stock audits.

Multi-image Upload with Drag and Drop:
Make uploading item pictures easy and quick (drag and drop zone + preview thumbnails).

Role-based Data Access:
Limit storekeeper access strictly to inventory/shipments ‚Äî no access to financials or sales reports to maintain business privacy.

Simple Analytics:
Add a small dashboard card like:

‚ÄúItems added this month: 120‚Äù

‚ÄúLow stock items: 5‚Äù (Gives motivation without overwhelming them.)

Real-Time Inventory Update:
After uploading or editing, inventory lists refresh automatically without reloading the page.
