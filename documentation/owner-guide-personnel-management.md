## Best Practices for Managing Sales Personnel

- **Proper Role Assignment**: Ensure sales staff have the "sales" role assignment to process in-store orders
- **Regular Password Changes**: Require personnel to change their password every 90 days
- **Role Separation**: Maintain separation of duties (e.g., separate inventory management from sales)
- **Performance Review**: Regularly review sales performance metrics
- **Audit Access**: Periodically audit who has access to the system

## Important Security Notes

- All personnel actions are logged in the system for accountability
- Each account should be used by only one individual
- Deactivate accounts immediately when staff leave the organization
- Accounts are traceable to specific transactions and orders
- Personnel with sales roles can only access features appropriate to their responsibilities
